                    My name is Grant Wiswell and in my free time I love to program,
                    usually for game development.
                    
                    When I'm not developing a game I love playing games, going to the gym,
                    and hanging out with my girlfriend.
                </p>

                    My favorite games right now are games that involve a lot of automation like Factorio and Satisfactory.
                    I also enjoy playing World of Warcraft with my girlfriend.
